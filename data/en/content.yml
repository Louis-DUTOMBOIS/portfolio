There are the three dimensions of Minecraft, an inventory, blocks to mine and use for different crafts, as well as different biomes and terrain structures.

First, a descriptive file of the scene is read, then the image is generated using different methods and classes. Finally, the image is created and available for download. The calculation of pixels is done by calculating vectors and points, taking into account the camera, lights and different shapes. The project was carried out in Java. The implementation of design patterns was central: states, singletons, decorators, builders, etc. The description file has its own syntax, it is read by a Scanner, then the information is transcribed to create the image."
